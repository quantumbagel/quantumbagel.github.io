                **FiniteCraft** is my and @Pixelz22's project to make a great autocrafter for Neal Agarwal's Infinite Craft.
            
                We plan for it to include:
            
                - Proxy selection algorithm (in progress)
            
                - An proxy-based crafter (completed)
            
                - A craft tree (not started)
            
                - A frontend website (not started)
                
                This project is in an extremely early stage, so the linked GitHub may not work yet!
                This page will be updated every-so-often to reflect updates, but please use the GitHub link for the most up-to-date information.
