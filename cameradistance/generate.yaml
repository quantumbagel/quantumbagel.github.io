                **CameraDistance** is a drone-following script for NC State's AERPAW drones.
                      
                It controls AXIS cameras supporting VAPIX to track MavLink/ArduPilot drones and record video of the drones.
                
                Its features include
                
                - Customizable recording triggers
            
                - Can zoom to fit drone in view or with a certain amount of space around it
            
                - Can handle drone software crashes or disconnects and quickly recover
            
                - Can support as many drones as you need via config
            
                - Works with any AXIS PTZ camera supporting VAPIX or any ArduPilot/MavLink based drone and many more!
