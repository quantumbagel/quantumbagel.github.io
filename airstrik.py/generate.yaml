                This is **airstrik.py**, the precursor to [PyAerial](pyaerial). 
                        
                It includes many features including: _(from the README)_
                        
                * Uses MongoDB to store plane data
                
                * Very space-efficient, only storing the data from the plane''s closest location.
                
                * Can run inside Docker Compose
                
                * Customizable filters
                
                * Can predict when a airplane will enter the zone set using trigonometry
                
                It also has many downsides, including:
                
                - Inefficient calculations (O(N^2) or worse)
                
                - Lack of customizability when it comes to MongoDB
                
                - No geofence zones
              
                - Non-customizable triggers
                
                All of these issues should be resolved when [PyAerial](pyaerial) comes out.
