                **DroneTracker** is a drone-following script for NC State's AERPAW drones.
                      
                It controls AXIS cameras supporting VAPIX to track MavLink/ArduPilot drones and record video of the drones.
                
                Its features include
                
                - Tailored for AERPAW's need
            
                - Can zoom to fit drone in view or with a certain amount of space around it
            
                - Can handle drone software crashes or disconnects and quickly recover
            
                - Integrates perfectly with Kafka for detailed telemetry and information.
            
                - Works with **any** AXIS PTZ camera supporting VAPIX!
